<h1>Calander</h1>

<p>Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and shows updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.</p>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<p>With the assistance of third party, I was able to make it so when one opened the html in a browser the current date would display</p>

<p>I created a function that would store data into localStorage</p>

<p>I then created another funcction that would load the data found in the localStorage and another function that would display the data found in there</p>

<p>I used an "if" statement to color code the time blocks based on whether the time block is past the current time (pink), is the current time (yellow), or has not occured yet (seagreen).</p>

<p>The next step was to create the save button on the end of each row using third-party's custom commands from sources like jQuery and Bootstrap</p>

<p>I then appended the elements to a row and stored the information in an array</p>
